# Random Walk

Random walk is when you have a pointer starts at 0 on the number line and there is a 50% chance that the pointer will either go left or right on the number line

This program calculates the placement of a pointer and the number of times that pointer crosses 0 on a random walk.

This program also lets you adjust the 50% chance to any percent you like
